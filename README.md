# What is this

My fifth project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a Weather App**.

## How I started

I watched the the videos provided for this week, and during the "Space people" code along video I did it myself and paused every now and then do test different things. The code along was without doubt the most helpful tool during this project. Without it I would have been lost.

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

I struggled with knowing where to put styling, there is styling all over the place. In the HTML, CSS (obviously) and Javascript. I'm not at all pleased with my HTML code structure and I feel sorry for the poor soul who is going the read my code.

### What I'm proud of

I'm proud of a lot of things. I did some pretty cool stuff this week, the background gradients change with the temperature. The icon not only changes with weather type but it also "breathes". I have also added a night mode, during the night there is a darker gradient and a sleeping full moon.

I'm also proud of my mobile footer, where I used two gradient styled `<hr>` to make a some what discrete footer.

## If I had more time

I would pretty much start from scratch to organise my code in a better way. With the knowledge I have now I feel as if it could have been done in a much better way.
